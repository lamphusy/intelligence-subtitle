1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Yo, I'm KBHD here.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,679
 Welcome to your first look and hands-on

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,759
 within Nintendo Switch 2.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,000
 And this is everything you need to know.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Obviously, one of the hottest and most anticipated

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,759
 new consoles in a long time.

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,640
 So when Nintendo invited me to this little hands-on

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,120
 in New York City with a few other YouTubers, obviously,

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,960
 I said yes.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,879
 So the first switch, I don't know if you remember,

11
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,679
 came out in 2017.

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,920
 So naturally, almost a decade later,

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,839
 there's a bunch of stuff that people,

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,039
 including myself, and mere casual,

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,159
 have been waiting for for this to be updated,

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,320
 and spoiler alert, they basically,

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,480
 I think, hit every single one of those things,

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,759
 but there is one big asterisk kind of overhanging all of it.

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,719
 So general form factor wise, this shape,

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,719
 very familiar, it looks like a switch.

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,600
 I've probably already seen the images online,

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,079
 but it is noticeably bigger.

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,400
 So it's the same thickness as the first generation,

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,560
 but it feels thinner because everything's kind of spread

25
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,400
 out more.

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,280
 The body's bigger, the joy cons are bigger,

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
 and it's mostly driven by this big new screen.

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,319
 So it's now a 7.9 inch display up front,

29
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,959
 up from 6.2.

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,439
 And this is still an LCD, but it's now a 1080p,

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,359
 variable refresh rate LCD that gets up to 120 hertz,

32
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,840
 and it just looks so much better than the original switch.

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,840
 It looks plenty bright to me too.

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
 It supports HDR as well.

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,319
 Notably, it's not an OLED though,

36
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,959
 so it doesn't have the perfectly inky blacks

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,319
 or the battery life advantages that come with an OLED.

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,879
 I do kind of think that we're eventually also going

39
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,639
 to see a switch to OLED.

40
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:35,559
 I think that makes sense.

41
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,919
 It'll probably be in a few years.

42
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,439
 It's probably also going to be a switch to light

43
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,959
 in a few years as well.

44
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,479
 Doesn't mean you have to wait for those.

45
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,239
 It's just something to keep in mind in the back of your head.

46
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,280
 But yeah, I'm definitely loving the variable refresh rate

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
 up to 120 hertz.

48
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,359
 Every game they're showing here takes advantage of it.

49
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,599
 You know how iPhone defenders always love to say,

50
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,959
 oh, you know, people can't tell the difference

51
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,479
 between 60 and 120 hertz.

52
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,599
 It's just no big deal.

53
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,280
 But you know, higher refresh rate and gaming go hand in hand.

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,839
 So I think a lot of people will appreciate the smoother games

55
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,679
 and potentially also the smoother UI that comes with it.

56
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,799
 So the screen is the biggest improvement.

57
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:10,840
 Now there are some other, you know,

58
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,359
 nice quality of life improvements here,

59
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:15,039
 like the full width kickstand that lets you prop it up

60
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,280
 at a pretty wide variety of angles,

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,079
 including almost all the way down similar to the switch OLED.

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,800
 But they added another port up to the top as well.

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,080
 And that makes it easier to charge

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,600
 while the console's kind of sitting on a table

65
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,560
 or something since that was a pain before.

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,080
 And it's also perfect for the additional USB type C accessories

67
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,280
 which I'll get to in a second.

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,320
 But I think the other obvious biggest upgrade

69
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,760
 is the new Joy-Cons.

70
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,200
 So many things are better about these new Joy-Cons.

71
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,160
 First of all, they are bigger like everything else,

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,240
 which ergonomically is very welcome.

73
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,920
 The left and right sticks are larger too.

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,719
 There's a new C button down here for Game Chat,

75
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,919
 which I will also get to in a second.

76
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,079
 And then they connect to the main console with magnets

77
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,479
 in a really satisfying way.

78
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,439
 They basically just slap right onto the side

79
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,119
 and line up automatically, no slide necessary.

80
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,079
 Love a good magnet.

81
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,399
 You get them off by holding this release button here,

82
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:12,039
 which is literally just a lever that pushes the Joy-Con

83
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,079
 off the side of the switch.

84
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,719
 And I think it's really nicely calibrated.

85
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,439
 If you just touch the release button, but don't pull,

86
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,079
 the Joy-Con actually pushes off,

87
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,800
 but then snaps right back on because the magnet is so strong.

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,199
 But if you release and pull, then it just pops off really easily.

89
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,079
 And then you can snap it back on whenever you want

90
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,359
 with a nice click.

91
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:33,319
 Now, the neat thing is most of the Joy-Con

92
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,360
 is still made a plastic to be lightweight.

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,159
 But at the top here, these SR and SL buttons,

94
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,400
 first of all, they are way bigger than last gen,

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,759
 but they're also actually made of the metal

96
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,639
 that the magnets in the console are attracted to.

97
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,359
 They're steel buttons.

98
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,679
 So that's why the connection between the Joy-Con's

99
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,439
 and the switch are so strong.

100
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,199
 It's that metal right there.

101
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,759
 My only worry here is actually just durability.

102
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,119
 So you can see when you pull that Joy-Con off,

103
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,479
 you can see these pins on the switch.

104
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,279
 And I kind of wonder how many little kids

105
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,599
 are going to bend those pins?

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,719
 Like, there is a tiny bit of wiggle actually built-in

107
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,879
 to hopefully make it not snap too easily.

108
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,439
 But yeah, there's no way to tell until they start shipping

109
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,639
 these to real people.

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,159
 And we start seeing the stories rolling in,

111
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,439
 but I'm gonna keep an eye on that.

112
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,399
 Oh, and there's also stronger feeling haptics.

113
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,079
 They're called HD Rumble 2.

114
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,759
 The Rumble pack is directly attached to the plastic

115
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,079
 and the back of the Joy-Con's.

116
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,639
 They feel nice and strong, a little bit more precise too.

117
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,439
 So that's really nice.

118
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,039
 And then lastly, each Joy-Con can also be used

119
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,360
 as a mouse in supporting games.

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,919
 I did not see this one coming.

121
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,360
 It's kind of interesting idea, but basically,

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
 there's a small optical sensor on the side of the Joy-Con.

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
 So if you turn that Joy-Con horizontally

124
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,680
 and place that sensor down on a table,

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,840
 you can move it around like a mouse, even rotate it,

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,639
 and that acts as yet another input method

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,720
 that apparently certain games will work pretty well with.

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,400
 I was doing this demo of a wheelchair basketball game.

129
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,720
 And so it ended up being pretty intuitive.

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,160
 You kind of hold the triggers and push forward

131
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
 and you would move forward in the game.

132
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,240
 Never would have thought it would work so well,

133
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,400
 but there's a good amount of sensitivity.

134
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,480
 Apparently, you can do this while swiping forward

135
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,280
 on your jeans and your lap too, if you wanted to.

136
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,799
 Other surfaces should work as well.

137
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,159
 In the Nintendo Direct livestream,

138
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,119
 they also showed this other golf game

139
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,679
 where you move the putter around and rotate it

140
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,679
 and then make a stroke using the mouse motion

141
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,719
 all on a table like a mouse.

142
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,759
 So yeah, I guess that makes sense.

143
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,399
 We'll see what other games end up using this control.

144
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,279
 Now, we didn't get a whole lot of other specifics

145
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,119
 like the chip it's running or even how much RAM it has,

146
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,599
 which admittedly, you know, a lot of switch buyers

147
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,439
 just don't care about.

148
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,879
 But one big spec that they did improve

149
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,040
 is they've gone from 32 gigs of storage

150
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,040
 on the original switch to 256 gigs of storage

151
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,079
 and the storage is faster.

152
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,800
 So I definitely appreciate this.

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,959
 You can see my switch, home screen behind me.

154
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,959
 I could only fit three games on my switch

155
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,000
 because one of them is Rocket League

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,360
 and it was like 17 gigs.

157
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,399
 But I also think this will directly relate

158
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,639
 to how much larger switch two games will probably be.

159
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,399
 So 256 gigs will feel in line with the larger file sizes,

160
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,519
 you know, bigger textures, higher resolution and all that.

161
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,399
 Switch two games will probably also be bigger too.

162
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,719
 So thankfully, there is still microSD card support.

163
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:20,759
 It lives right here under the hinge again

164
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,439
 and you'll specifically have to get a microSD express card

165
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,240
 to play games off it on the switch too.

166
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,079
 But I think generally they'll be pretty easy to find.

167
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,479
 I already saw Lexar is gonna be making

168
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,000
 a one terabyte microSD card just for the switch too.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,199
 So that's awesome.

170
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,120
 Now the switch isn't a switch without the dock

171
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,639
 and the new dock supports 4K resolution out to a TV.

172
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,599
 Love to see that.

173
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,599
 There's actually also a fan in the switch two dock

174
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,599
 that turns on wild woods docked.

175
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,919
 So while it's cranking out that extra resolution,

176
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,519
 it doesn't get too hot.

177
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,680
 But from there, I feel like all of the new software features

178
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,919
 have a bit of a theme.

179
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
 This switch two feels like a much more social console.

180
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,639
 Like there was, I think Nintendo saw a ton of success

181
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,919
 with the original switch and started thinking about

182
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,759
 more ways to make it a better experience

183
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,839
 because now there's, there are gonna be groups of people

184
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,039
 where several of them have a switch.

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,679
 So when you hit that new C button on the JoyCon,

186
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,279
 it brings up this new menu called Game Chat.

187
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,919
 So they didn't let us do this in the demos

188
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,039
 that I tried today, but in Nintendo Direct,

189
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,719
 you can see the idea is if you have some friends

190
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:25,519
 on other switches gaming at the same time as you,

191
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,359
 you can all turn your mics on and talk to each other

192
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,279
 or even turn screen sharing on to see each other's

193
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,759
 gameplay live, which is cool.

194
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,799
 I know a lot of people do FaceTime while gaming

195
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,120
 and kind of want to combine the whole experience.

196
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,399
 I personally probably wouldn't do this,

197
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,280
 but I totally get it.

198
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,199
 And it's funny, it was actually refreshing

199
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,480
 seeing this in Nintendo's official footage.

200
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,199
 You can see the gameplay from other people

201
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,759
 as you're watching it is kind of laggy

202
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,120
 and it's kind of low resolution, but it's totally fine.

203
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
 Like this makes me believe more

204
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,280
 that what we're seeing here is exactly how it'll look.

205
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
 Like Nintendo didn't want to make any fake promises.

206
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,920
 Like, oh, it'll be 1080p when you watch other people game.

207
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,199
 But hey, at least you'll have an idea

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
 of what's going on on their screen.

209
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,599
 So that's cool.

210
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,959
 But not only that, if you get this optional accessory here,

211
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,679
 which is called the Switch 2 camera,

212
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,719
 this little thing plugs into that top port

213
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:18,439
 on the Switch when you're docked

214
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,839
 or I think you can even plug it straight

215
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,319
 into the dock itself.

216
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,319
 And when you point it at yourself,

217
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,279
 it can automatically cut you out from the background

218
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,000
 and put your face next to your gameplay.

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,639
 So it literally feels like a gaming version

220
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,879
 of a Zoom call or something.

221
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,839
 Like everyone can see their friends' faces

222
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,720
 and their friends' reactions to the games in real time.

223
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,519
 And some games will even integrate that feed a little more,

224
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,360
 like putting your face over where an avatar would normally be.

225
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,800
 It's like video chatting while playing a game.

226
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,160
 It's not going to be the highest fidelity thing ever,

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,280
 but it'll be a sort of extra layer on top

228
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
 and makes it feel more social.

229
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,399
 So Game Chat is cool when you're in multiple different places,

230
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,800
 but there's also going to be situations

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,879
 where multiple people are all gaming

232
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,720
 in the same physical place with Switches.

233
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,160
 And so they built a feature just for that,

234
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,959
 which is being able to share a game

235
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,199
 with other people who don't have it yet,

236
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,199
 up to three other people.

237
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,399
 So one Switch 2 is the host,

238
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,439
 and then up to three other Switches,

239
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,360
 they don't have to have the game installed at all.

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,759
 It's just one guy goes, all right guys,

241
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,159
 I'll have this game raw gonna play it in the same room.

242
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,759
 And every one of you now temporarily has this game,

243
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,120
 and you can play your own perspective of the multiplayer,

244
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,480
 whatever without having to buy or install,

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,720
 the whole thing at that moment.

246
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,679
 I'm not sure exactly how long it'll take to set up

247
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,720
 or like exactly which games will support it,

248
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,480
 but a Switch 2 can host,

249
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,160
 and then up to three other Switches can join.

250
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,800
 It's called Game Share.

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,639
 I like it a lot.

252
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,480
 And then actually speaking of games,

253
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,759
 there's basically gonna be three types of games

254
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,960
 for the Switch 2.

255
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,840
 There will be native Switch 2 games.

256
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,480
 And those are the ones that are the most optimized

257
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,600
 and should look the best with the best graphics,

258
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
 potentially taking the most advantage

259
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,440
 of the extra features and Game Chat and mouse controls.

260
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
 Then there will be Switch 1 games,

261
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
 some of which will be compatible with the Switch 2,

262
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,320
 which might not look as good.

263
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,920
 And then there will be Switch 1 games

264
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,320
 that get kind of remastered or updated for the Switch 2,

265
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
 so like a Switch 2 version of the game.

266
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,280
 So hopefully you don't have to pay a full price

267
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
 for a whole new game.

268
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,000
 You'll pay a smaller amount for an updated version

269
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
 of the game for the Switch 2.

270
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,800
 But I think that pretty conveniently brings us

271
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,840
 to the big asterisk hovering over all of this,

272
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,720
 which is pricing.

273
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,720
 See, the Switch 2 is gonna start off at $449 in the US.

274
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,840
 Now, I've seen mixed reactions to that price.

275
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
 Obviously, the Switch 1 was amazing.

276
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,280
 It was 300 bucks, but that was almost 10 years ago.

277
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,360
 So now, you know, new specs and updates,

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,480
 and inflation and tariffs and all of that.

279
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,639
 To me, actually makes $449 feel like

280
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,320
 a pretty reasonable price.

281
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,879
 The Switch 2 camera accessory is 50 bucks.

282
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,720
 Feels about right.

283
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,879
 There's also a new Switch 2 Pro controller

284
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,560
 with new back buttons, plus a headphone jack,

285
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,440
 and of course the added C button.

286
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,519
 That'll be around $80.

287
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,360
 But then the game pricing is where they start

288
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,879
 to lose people a little bit.

289
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,360
 It's reported that Switch 2 games are gonna be around

290
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,320
 80 bucks just for a digital download Switch 2 game.

291
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,399
 90 bucks if you want the physical version.

292
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,360
 That definitely feels really high.

293
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,120
 There are so many great PC and console games,

294
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,080
 and even Switch 1 games in the store

295
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,639
 in like the 50 to $60 range right now.

296
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,920
 NBA 2K25 is like my staple for an expensive game.

297
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,080
 That's 70 bucks on the PS5.

298
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,879
 So pushing that up again, 80 to 90 bucks

299
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,800
 for a Switch 2 game does feel kind of like it's pushing it.

300
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
 And then they also announced this really smart looking

301
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,120
 demo game called Welcome Tor that basically walks you

302
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,000
 through all the features, unless you demo everything

303
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,080
 and really get to know the Switch 2 well.

304
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,639
 Kind of reminds me of Astro's playroom on the PlayStation 5,

305
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,120
 which did the exact same thing,

306
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,600
 helped you learn what the DualSense controller

307
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,160
 was capable of, and that was free.

308
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,240
 That actually came pre-installed on the PS5 at launch.

309
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,200
 And Nintendo has even done Wii Sports in the past,

310
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,519
 which was a free demo game that came on the Nintendo Wii,

311
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,600
 and low key turned out to be one of the greatest games

312
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,440
 of all time.

313
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,320
 The Nintendo Switch 2 demo game though is paid.

314
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,840
 It's not included for free.

315
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,039
 It's going to be like 10 or 20 bucks

316
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,720
 or something like that in the store.

317
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,759
 But even just having it paid at all to me

318
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,840
 seems like a huge miss.

319
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,240
 That's going to be so many people that are not going to experience

320
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,399
 it, that are not going to be able to fully walk through it

321
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,120
 and understand and get to know their Switch 2

322
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,519
 because no one's going to go buy that demo game.

323
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,639
 I don't know what they were thinking there.

324
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,039
 Other than that though, the Switch 2 seems pretty sweet,

325
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,879
 not going to lie.

326
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,720
 I really like it.

327
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,919
 There's a reason the original Switch was one

328
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,079
 of the best selling consoles of all time.

329
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,679
 It was well priced, great form factor, very versatile.

330
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,840
 For me, the perfect airplane game console.

331
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,720
 I would say the signs are pointing to Switch 2 also

332
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,279
 being really good again.

333
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,360
 But there are also definitely some things we still don't know.

334
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,680
 Like for example, we obviously don't know the chip and the RAM.

335
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,440
 We do know it's confirmed that there is some amount of DLSS happening.

336
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,360
 I would assume that to do 4K on a TV.

337
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
 There's some amount of upscaling happening.

338
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,600
 We just don't know exactly how much yet.

339
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,519
 But then also battery life.

340
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,240
 How similar or different will battery life potentially be

341
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,879
 from the first Switch?

342
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,800
 Having a bigger, higher refresh rate,

343
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,320
 higher resolution screen tends to eat battery life.

344
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
 But it's also bigger.

345
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,120
 So the battery capacity can be bigger.

346
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,039
 So maybe it just balances out in its similar TBD.

347
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,839
 I don't think fast charging is announced or anything created like that.

348
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,159
 But then also things like durability.

349
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,959
 And whether they fix Joy-Con drift or not.

350
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,639
 These are all things that are TBD.

351
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,519
 And then I think would be great to find out for a full review.

352
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,079
 So maybe get subscribed if you're interested in seeing something like that

353
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,199
 to be among the first to see it.

354
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,679
 And let me know in the comments down below what else you want to see.

355
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,439
 Now if you're one of those people who's just going to pre-order no matter what,

356
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,039
 then I highly recommend checking out the Kill Switch from Channel Sponsor D brand.

357
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,399
 See originally the Kill Switch line was developed for the Steam Deck.

358
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,799
 And then ended up being one of the best possible Steam Deck cases.

359
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,120
 So now they're taking this same formula and making it for the Switch 2.

360
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,079
 Plus some cool extras.

361
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,159
 So there's a travel cover.

362
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,199
 So just like the Steam Deck version, it will be super protective.

363
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,759
 So you can toss it in a bag or wherever else you want.

364
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,399
 But then for the Switch 2, they added a game card holder.

365
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,199
 So you can hold up to 10 games with you.

366
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,720
 And you can even see them through the frosted finish.

367
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,120
 They've also added some ergonomic hand grips and unlike other Switch cases,

368
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
 they also detach with the Joy-Con.

369
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
 But the whole point of the Switch 2 is that when you take it with you on the go,

370
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,360
 you can dock it when you get home, right?

371
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,799
 Most cases aren't going to fit inside the dock,

372
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,600
 but D brand solved that one too with a dock adapter that they're including with every purchase.

373
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,639
 So if you want to check them out, hit them up at dbrand.com slash Switch 2.

374
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,039
 Either way, thanks for watching this first look.

375
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,120
 Let me know what you think in the comments below.

376
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,840
 And I'll catch you the next one.

377
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
 Peace.
