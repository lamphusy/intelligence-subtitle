1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 We have no reliable heroes.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 And yet we still need protection.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Witness, the invincible,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 stronger than all of the Avengers rolled into one,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 and soon to be known as Earth's mightiest hero.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Why would a god take orders from anyone at all?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Maybe I need to show you what I'm capable of.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Sentry's gone off the rails, and he's dangerous.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Avengers, you're gone. No one is coming to save the day.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 We could be the people that are coming.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Wait, us?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Yeah, you.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Why, you got some place to be?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I love that guy.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Bucky, you have the wrong people.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 We have all done bad things.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 You can live with it forever.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Or you can do something about it.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Being the hero, saving people in the streets,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 there is no higher calling.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 You guys done with therapy?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Let's do this.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 You may not see what I see,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 but this has the makings of a team that can raise to glory.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 There's no use fighting.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 You're not Earth's mightiest heroes.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 No, we are the Thunderbolts!

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Thunderbolts.
